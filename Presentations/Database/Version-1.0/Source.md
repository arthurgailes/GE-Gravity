# Introduction
- The USITC Gravity Database project is an effort to improve gravity research by creating and maintaining a comprehensive, well-documented, database of gravity variables.
---
# History
- The gravity dataset made available by CEPII has become a mainstay of international trade research.
- However, the CEPII dataset has limitations:
  - Update frequency
  - Time-invariant variables for time-variant data
  - Variable definition inconsistencies
???
- Prior to the 2017 update, the dataset was last updated in 2006.
- For many variables that have obvious variance over time--such as population-weighted distance--the CEPII variables remain constant.
- For other variables, definitions are inconsistently applied.
---
# Variables
- The variables in the USITC Gravity Database can be categorized as:
  1. Culture
  2. Economy
  3. Geography
  4. Politics
  5. Population
???
- The database has many variables, but can be described in terms of four categories: culture, geography, politics, and population.
- Culture variables describe data such as a common language or a common colonizer.
- Economy variables describe data such as a common currency or a similar market system.
- Geography variables describe data such as population-weighted distance or a shared land border.
- Politics variables describe data such as similar political systems or legal regimes.
- Population variables describe data such as median household income or labor force demographics.

# Proposals
- The USITC Gravity Database aims to be an open and inclusive project.
- The database is designed to be open-source:
  - Review
  - Suggestion
  - Submission
???
- Moving forward, materials related to development and maintenance will be made public.
- Our hope is to model this as a collaborative, open-source project in which many others will join our efforts to maintain, improve, and extend the database.
- We welcome user feedback, suggestions, and data submissions:
  - This will improve overall quality by allowing for user-scrutiny of the entire data pipeline.
  - If a user does not agree with our methodology, they can offer their own improvements.
